Team 4 for Penn State DS 440 Capstone Spring 2022


File Breakdown:

Sarah: ResNet and Densenet files.














Used COVID-Net Dataset (https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net) and (https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset)


To run,
download data from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andyczhao/covidx-cxr2), (https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset)

and then model of choice (ResNet, etc)


then, choose explainability method choice (GradCAM, CAM, LIME, etc) and use with trained model.



Weijia: 

(1) Created deep neutral network based on resnet (https://github.com/sayruhpetro/ds440capstone_team4/blob/main/dnn_resnet.ipynb)
(2) Used Saliency Mapping (https://github.com/sayruhpetro/ds440capstone_team4/blob/main/saliency_mapping.ipynb)
(3) Used LIME (https://github.com/sayruhpetro/ds440capstone_team4/blob/main/lime.ipynb)

To run, please follow the guidance in each file, especially parts to set up the running environment.
